# Overview

Designing, making and sharing unique games, puzzles or shows is fun and rewarding.
Create stage and sprite designs for your project.
Connect the coloured blocks to bring your creation to live.
Be inspired by a whole world of community projects that bring art, music, 
science and maths together. 
Young creators learn the foundations of coding with logical blocks of 
Scratch programs which can be implemented in other languages. 
This project compares Scratch programs in R.

# Maze

The Maze Scratch projects are based on a project by Primary School children.

In this project you will see how visual Scratch code corresponds to text R code.

* Double click on shiny-maze/Scratch.Rproj
* Type `shiny::runApp("v0.1_thief")` to start the first version of the maze app.

This will launch an interactive maze game. Use the arrow keys to navigate the maze.
Discussion points:

* What could we improve about the game?
* What happens when the sprite arrives at the edge of the maze?
* How could we stop the sprite from passing through the walls?
